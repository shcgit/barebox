config DEV_MEM

config UBOOTVAR
	bool "U-Boot environment storage"
	help
	  This driver exposes U-Boot environment variable storage as a
	  single mmap-able device, hiding various low-level details
	  such as:
	      - Preamble format differences
	      - Read/write logic in presence of redundant partition

	  While it can be used standalone, it is best when coupled
	  with corresponding filesystem driver.
