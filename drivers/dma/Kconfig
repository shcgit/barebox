	  For most platforms supported, either all DMA is coherent or it isn't.
	  Platforms that have DMA masters of mixed coherency or that differ
	  from the architecture default will select this option to parse
	  DMA coherency out of the DT. This allows barebox to choose the
	  correct cache maintenance operation during runtime and will cause
	  barebox to fix up its own DMA coherency setting into the kernel
	  DT if it differs.
