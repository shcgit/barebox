menuconfig FS_SQUASHFS

	prompt "squashfs support"
	help
	  Saying Y here includes support for SquashFS 4.0 (a Compressed
	  Read-Only File System).  Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only
	  filesystem for Linux.  It uses zlib, lzo or xz compression to
	  compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes in the system
	  are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data overhead.
	  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 1 Mbytes
	  (default block size 128K).  SquashFS 4.0 supports 64 bit filesystems
	  and files (larger than 4GB), full uid/gid information, hard links and
	  timestamps.

	  Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for
	  archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in
	  embedded systems where low overhead is needed.  Further information
	  and tools are available from http://squashfs.sourceforge.net.

config SQUASHFS_XZ
	bool "Include support for XZ compressed file systems"
	default y
	depends on FS_SQUASHFS
	select XZ_DECOMPRESS
	help
	  Saying Y here includes support for reading Squashfs file systems
	  compressed with XZ compression.  XZ gives better compression than
	  the default zlib compression, at the expense of greater CPU and
	  memory overhead.

	  XZ is not the standard compression used in Squashfs and so most
	  file systems will be readable without selecting this option.
